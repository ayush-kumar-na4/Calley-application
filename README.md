# 📞 Calley App UI Clone (Flutter Implementation)

This project is a **fully functional Flutter clone** of the **Calley Automatic Call Dialer** application, designed based on a high-fidelity Figma prototype.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ✅ Pixel-perfect UI closely aligned (and enhanced) from the Figma design  
- 🌐 Multilingual onboarding with language selection  
- 🔐 Secure Signup/Login with Email OTP verification  
- 📊 Dashboard integration showing live call stats with beautiful chart UI  
- 📁 Mock API integration using provided endpoints (for user sessions, call lists, etc.)  
- ⚙️ Settings & App Info Panel with all listed options working  
- 🧭 Smooth navigation, consistent state handling, and responsive design across devices  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Flutter**
- **Dart**  
- **REST API Integration** (Mock APIs used for data simulation)  
- **Custom Widgets** for reusability and performance  
- **fl_chart** Pie charts for call stats  
- **Navigation Drawer**, Modal sheets, and Animations  

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Stand Out?

> This isn’t just a static UI — it’s a **fully interactive prototype** with mock data and navigation flow that closely mimics a production-ready business app.  
> The design was matched and **improved with Flutter-native UI best practices**, making it both scalable and performance-oriented.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Implemented a large-scale UI from Figma to Flutter  
- Improved design usability with responsive layout enhancements  
- Learned to connect and simulate full feature flows with mock APIs

## 🔍 API Testing

- 🧪 All APIs were thoroughly tested and verified using **Postman**.
- Verified:
  - OTP verification
  - Session storage simulation
  - Call list retrieval and dashboard data
- Ensured correct request headers, responses, and error handling.

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Integration with a real backend (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
- Offline support using Hive or SQflite
- Notifications for call-related events
- Option to switch state management to Riverpod or Bloc for scalability
